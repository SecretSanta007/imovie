# iMovie
Application for rapid and reliable movie collection management.
iMovie is a Personal Movie Collection Manager, which can scan your computer for movies, identify movie 
files and download movie details from internet.

# features
* It can scan your computer's hard disks for movie files, identify the movies automatically, and download all basic details about each       movie from internet, and creates a local database of your movie collection.

* Play, or open the folder of the movie you desire, directly from the application. You no more need to waste time by 
  searching your computer for movies. iMovie lists all your movies at one place. You can add as many folders as you like, and iMovie is     able to look for movie files inside those folders. All the basic details about the movie will be downloaded and displayed (such as         director, actors, plot, IMDB rating, genres, etc). The details are stored offline so that you don't need to connect to internet           everytime.

* Search for a particular movie, for the title of movie, director, any of actors, genres, etc. There is an intensive
  search area for you to work with.

* Mark a movie as watched, and filter movies that are watched, or not watched, or all.

* Sort movies according to title(alphabetical order), year(latest to oldest or oldest to latest), IMDb rating etc.

* Mark a movie as favorite, so that you can keep a favorite list of movies in your collection.

* Custom rate a movie out of 10, and store it.

* Update movie information at any time with any details you want to be updated, all from the internet without the need to 
  manually enter a value.
  
* You can give a copy of your application to a friend. then he/she can make a request list from your movies, and give the 
  generated list to you (it's a simple text file). then you load the list into your own application, and then automatically copy all of     those movies from your computer to an external device of your friend, sounds great? I think so.
